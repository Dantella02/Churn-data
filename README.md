# Churn-data
The purpose of this project is to use the bank chun data set to conduct EDA and logistic regression in order to predict whether or not a customer will chun.

The following is an example of the code that I used to import and read the data: data is read from the Churn Modelling.csv file using the pd.read csv function.
